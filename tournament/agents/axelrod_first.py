    Submitted to Axelrod's first tournament by James Graaskamp.

    The description written in [Axelrod1980]_ is:

    > This rule plays tit-for-tat for 50 moves, defects on move 51, and then
    > plays 5 more moves of tit-for-tat. A check is then made to see if the player
    > seems to be RANDOM, in which case it defects from then on. A check is also

    > Otherwise, it randomly defects every 5 to 15 moves, hoping that enough
    > trust has been built up so that the other player will not notice these
    > defections.:

    This is implemented as:

    1. Plays Tit For Tat for the first 50 rounds;
    2. Defects on round 51;
    3. Plays 5 further rounds of Tit For Tat;
    4. A check is then made to see if the opponent is playing randomly in which
       case it defects for the rest of the game. This is implemented with a chi
       squared test.
    5. The strategy also checks to see if the opponent is playing Tit For Tat or
       a clone of itself. If
       so it plays Tit For Tat. If not it cooperates and randomly defects every 5
       to 15 moves.

    Note that there is no information about 'Analogy' available thus Step 5 is
    a "best possible" interpretation of the description in the paper.
    Furthermore, the test for the clone is implemented as checking that both
    players have played the same moves for the entire game. This is unlikely to
    be the original approach but no further details are available.

    This strategy came 9th in Axelrodâ€™s original tournament.

    There is some room for interpretation as to how the strategy reacts to a
    defection on the turn where it starts to cooperate once more. In Shubik
    (1970) the strategy is described as:
    > "I will play my move 1 to begin with and will continue to do so, so long
    > as my information shows that the other player has chosen his move 1. If my
    > information tells me he has used move 2, then I will use move 2 for the

    > switch to move 2 for the k + 1 immediately subsequent periods . . . and so
    > on, increasing my retaliation by an extra period for each departure from the
    > (1, 1) steady state."
    This is interpreted as:
    The player cooperates, if when it is cooperating, the opponent defects it
    defects for k rounds. After k rounds it starts cooperating again and
    increments the value of k if the opponent defects again.
