    Submitted to Axelrod's first tournament by Morton Davis.

    This strategy came 8th in Axelrod's original tournament.

class Graaskamp(Agent):
    """
    Submitted to Axelrod's first tournament by James Graaskamp.

    The description written in [Axelrod1980]_ is:

    > "This rule plays tit for tat for 50 moves, defects on move 51, and then
    > plays 5 more moves of tit for tat. A check is then made to see if the player
    > seems to be RANDOM, in which case it defects from then on. A check is also
    > made to see if the other is TIT FOR TAT, ANALOGY (a program from the
    > preliminary tournament), and its own twin, in which case it plays tit for
    > tat. Otherwise it randomly defects every 5 to 15 moves, hoping that enough
    > trust has been built up so that the other player will not notice these
    > defections.:

    This is implemented as:

    1. Plays Tit For Tat for the first 50 rounds;
    2. Defects on round 51;
    3. Plays 5 further rounds of Tit For Tat;
    4. A check is then made to see if the opponent is playing randomly in which
       case it defects for the rest of the game. This is implemented with a chi
       squared test.
    5. The strategy also checks to see if the opponent is playing Tit For Tat or
       a clone of itself. If
       so it plays Tit For Tat. If not it cooperates and randomly defects every 5
       to 15 moves.

    Note that there is no information about 'Analogy' available thus Step 5 is
    a "best possible" interpretation of the description in the paper.
    Furthermore the test for the clone is implemented as checking that both
    players have played the same moves for the entire game. This is unlikely to
    be the original approach but no further details are available.

    This strategy came 9th in Axelrodâ€™s original tournament.
